Hi {{ user.first_name }},

It has been over 3 weeks since you last reported your activities :)
These reports are really important for the success of the Mozilla Reps program and
they are also valuable for your mentor.

You can report your activities here:
{{ SITE_URL }}{{ url('reports_new_ng_report') }}

We understand you are busy, and if you have not had time to work on Mozilla Reps stuff,
please take a moment to send a note to your mentor to let them know.

{{ mentor.get_full_name() }}
{{ SITE_URL }}
{{- url('profiles_view_profile', display_name=mentor.userprofile.display_name) }}
{{ mentor.email }}

Cheers!

The Mozilla Reps Council
